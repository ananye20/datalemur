Usually in classification problems, where the data is usually imbalanced we use precision and recall as metrics.

Precision : Out of all predicted positives, how many are actually positive

Precision = TP/(FP+TP)

Recall : Out of all actual positives, how many are actually positives

Recall = TP/(TP+FN)

Where, TP = True Positives FP = False Positives TN = True Negatives FN = False Negatives

Precision Recall Tradeoff Precision and Recall are inversely proportional. Whenever precision increases recall decreases, and when recall increases then precision decreases.
